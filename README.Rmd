**swissMunicipalities** gives access to official historicized lists of municipalities of Switzerland using the official [REST API of the Swiss Federal Statistical Office](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/dienstleistungen/forschung/api/api-gemeinde.html).

More information about the API can be found [here](https://www.bfs.admin.ch/bfs/de/home/dienstleistungen/forschung/api/api-gemeinde.html).

## Installation

You can install the development version of swissMunicipalities like so:

``` r
library(remotes)

remotes::install_github("SwissStatsR/swissMunicipalities")
```

## Get historicized lists of Swiss municipalities

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(swissMunicipalities)
```

### Snapshot

Use `get_snapshots()` to get a "snapshot" of all municipalities (`Level` = 1), districts (`Level` = 2) and cantons (`Level` = 3) as of today.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
snapshot <- get_snapshots() # snapshot of today by default

snapshot
```

By default, the FSO number is returned. To get the historicized ID, add `hist_id = TRUE` in the `get_snapshots()` function.

If you want to get a snapshot of a given period, use the  that exist for at least part of the specified period (or of a specified day when `start_period` and `end_period` have the exact same date).

```{r}
get_snapshots(start_period = "2023-01-01", end_period = "2023-12-31")
```

> :information_source: **When using `start_period` and `end_period` arguments, the date should be in format "yyyy-mm-dd" (for example "2024-08-01").**

Using the `Level` column, you can extract the existing list of cantons (`Level` = 1), districts (`Level` = 2) and municipalities (`Level` = 3) and join them to consolidate the municipality dataset.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr) # just for data wrangling examples

municipalities <- snapshot |> 
  filter(Level == 3) |>
  rename_with(~ paste0(.x, "_municipality", recycle0 = TRUE)) |>
  select(-Level_municipality)

districts <- snapshot |> 
  filter(Level == 2) |>
  rename_with(~ paste0(.x, "_district", recycle0 = TRUE)) |>
  select(-Level_district)

cantons <- snapshot |> 
  filter(Level == 1) |>
  rename_with(~ paste0(.x, "_canton", recycle0 = TRUE)) |>
  select(-Level_canton)

# consolidate municipality data with districts and cantons levels
municipalities_consolidated <- municipalities |>
  left_join(districts, by = join_by(Parent_municipality == Identifier_district)) |>
  left_join(cantons, by = join_by(Parent_district == Identifier_canton)) |>
  rename(Identifier_district = Parent_municipality, Identifier_canton = Parent_district) |>
  select(starts_with(c("Name", "ABBREV", "Identifier", "Valid")), everything()) |>
  arrange(Identifier_municipality, Identifier_district)

# get all municipalities of St. Gallen for the given period
municipalities_consolidated |>
  filter(Name_de_canton == "St. Gallen")
```

Note that the `CODE_OFS*` variables refers to the official Swiss community identification number (also called "GEOSTAT"/"BFS" number) and the `CODE_HIST*` corresponds to the "historical number".

### Mutations

Access all the mutation list which describes all changes related to municipalities that occurred during the specified period.

To exclude records that only concern territory changes, use `include_territory_exchange = FALSE`.

```{r}
get_mutations(
  start_period = "2023-01-01", 
  end_period = "2023-12-31", 
  include_territory_exchange = FALSE
)
```

### Correspondances

Get the municipality correspondances, which indicates for each municipality existing at the `start_period` time, which is/are the corresponding municipality(ies) at the `end_period` time.

To exclude districts and municipalities that have not undergone any changes, add `include_unmodified = FALSE`.

```{r}
get_correspondances(
  start_period = "2022-01-01", 
  end_period = "2022-12-31", 
  include_unmodified = FALSE, 
  include_territory_exchange = FALSE
)
```

### Levels

The geographical levels offer several classifications of municipalities according to, for example, linguistic regions, agglomerations or even the degree of urbanization.

By default, the FSO number is returned. To get the historicized ID, add `hist_id = TRUE` in the `get_levels()` function. You can change the `label_languages` between French ("fr"), German ("de"), Italian ("it") and English ("en").

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
get_levels(label_languages = "de") # as of today by default
```

## Acknowledgements

This R package is inspired by **[swissmuni](https://gitlab.com/rpkg.dev/swissmuni/)** created by Salim BrÃ¼ggemann. As **swissmuni** is available only for the latest version of R and rely on several R package dependencies which are not on CRAN, this R package provides a simplified R wrapper of the API with minimal dependencies so it can be used on older versions of R (R >= 4.0).
